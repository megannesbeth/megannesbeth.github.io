<div id="bio">
<p class="important">I'm a traveler and a dreamer heading into the best year of my life. </p>

<P>I am a born, raised, and forever native of New York City, but I finally decided to let my frequent weekend trips to DC lead me to a new home for this next chapter. </p>

<p>My academic background is in sociology and anthropology and my career thus far has been primarily within education administration and events management. I have worked for General Assembly (GA) for a little over two years during which time I led a sales and admissions team, produced a plethora of events, and most recently joined the social impact team which I am a part of today.  I am currently the program manager for GA's Opportunity Fund, a scholarship fund focused on increasing access to careers in tech and design, and a proud StartingBloc fellow and alumna of Middlebury College.</p>

<p>After spending my early career helping others to pursue the work that they love I am starting to define the work that I love.  My big drivers at work are tackling big problems, connecting with people authentically, and building communities that allow for synergetic and magical moments.  I am always looking for opportunities to further hone my facilitation and design thinking skills and to learn more about the urban design, landscape architecture, service design, coaching and management consulting industries. I have strong skills in oral and written communication, project management, and interdisciplinary thinking that serve me in any industry I explore.</p>

<p>My upcoming travels include Miami, Costa Rica, and as always, Vermont.</p>
